1 This hotel has a nice view of the citycenter. The location is perfect.
2 The breakfast is ok. Regaring location, it is quite fat from the citycenter. But price is cheap, so it is ok.
1 Location is excellent, 5 min from citycenter. There is also a metro station pretty close to the hotel.
1 They said I couldn't take my dog. But there were other guests with dogs! That is not fair.
2 Very friendly staff and good cost-benefit ratio. Its location is a bit far from citycenter.
